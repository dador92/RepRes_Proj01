# RepRes_Proj01, Project 1, Reproducible Research course

## NOTE TO GRADERS
Files are arranged per the project instructions, but ...

The HTML file **PA1_template.html** is *too large* to view on GitHub. It can be viewed by viewing the *raw* html file, saving it to your local computer, and then opening up that local copy with your web browser.

Alternatively, the **PA1_template.md** file can be fully viewed on GitHub â€” just click on its link. I think the .md file may look slightly better than the .html file anyway.
